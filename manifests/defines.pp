# create a config file with default permissions
# Adapted From: http://git.black.co.at/?p=manifests.git;a=blob;f=modules/common/manifests/defines/config_file.pp;h=c57c9a3bd4535d56c5af79ffec9b94b6a2300c18;hb=HEAD
#
# config_file is a shortcut for a plain old 'file' resource.  It
# uses a default mode of 0644, owner root, and group root.
#
# Whenever the file is overwritten, puppet will create a backup of the file
# suffixed with pupppet-backup next to the file.
#
# You may specify source or content.  source by default comes from the dist
# directory, so it is not necessary to specify the full 'puppet://...' URL.
#
# Usage:
#     To render the file from a template:
#       file { "/etc/exports":   content => template("ops/exports.erb") }
#     To copy the file from a source:
#       file { "/etc/hosts":     source  => "puppet:///files/common/hosts" }
#     To simply ensure the existence of a file:
#       file { "/etc/issue" }
#     By default, config_file will keep a backup of the original file suffixed
#     ".puppet-backup". To use a custom backup name:
#       file { "/etc/logrotate.d/httpd":     backup => "mybackup" }
#     OR, to make sure no backup is kept:
#       file { "/etc/logrotate.d/httpd":     backup => false }
#

#
#  supervisor_program { "query_workerd":

#
# If $log_directory is not specified, logs will be stored in
# /var/log/supervisord/$name.
#
# $subscribe_program = false means that the service will not be restarted if it's .ini file changes.
# $subscribe_program = true means that it will
# $subscribe_program = anything else will subscribe the service to that resource
#   you can use this to subscribe the program to another config file, if needed.
